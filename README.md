# Bubble-Sort Algorithm

Step 1: Prompt the user to enter the size of the array (n).
Step 2: Declare an array of size n.
Step 3: Loop through the array from i = 0 to n-1 to input the elements of the array.
Step 4: Loop through the array from i = 0 to n-1 and print each element.
Step 5: Declare a variable temp to temporarily hold array elements during swaps.
Step 6: Use a nested loop:
Outer loop: Iterate from i = 0 to n-2.
Inner loop: Iterate from j = 0 to n-2.
Condition: If arr[j] > arr[j+1], swap arr[j] and arr[j+1] using temp.
Step 7: Repeat the process until the array is sorted.
Step 8: Loop through the sorted array from i = 0 to n-1 and print each element.
Step 9: Terminate the program.
